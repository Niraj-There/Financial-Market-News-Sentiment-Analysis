# Financial-Market-News-Sentiment-Analysis :
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to financial markets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By extracting and interpreting the sentiment from news headlines and articles, the project seeks to provide insights into how news sentiment may correlate with market movements.

# Key Features:
Data Collection: Automatically fetches news articles from various financial news sources.
Text Processing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to classify the sentiment of the news articles as positive, negative, or neutral.
Visualization: Provides visual insights through graphs and charts to showcase the sentiment trends over time and their potential impact on financial markets.
Correlation Analysis: Explores the relationship between news sentiment and financial market indicators, such as stock prices or indices.

# Technologies Used:
~Python
Pandas, NumPy
~Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), VADER, TextBlob
~Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the influence of news sentiment on financial markets and can be further extended with more advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
